<p>Here is my first work that didn't get delivered:<br>

<div>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38691103<br>
<br>
An avalanche created by an earthquake, destroyed and covered an hotel in<br=
>
Rigopiano Italy, two days after the event there is still people to save und=
er<br>
the snow. The only group that has been saved managed to survive the cold by=
<br>
creating a fire under a part of ceiling that did not fall to close to the<b=
r>
ground. The hotel's guests were waiting to evacuate after the earthquake wh=
en<br>
the avalanche went over the building. The first team of rescuer arrived a l=
ong<br>
time after the hotel were destroyed, the authorities didn't believe one of =
the<br>
survivor who had to call back many times for two hours. Quite an amount of<=
br>
earthquake occured lately in Italy it is thought to be caused by stress on<=
br>
lines of discontinuity in rocks.<br>

<p>Hi Misses M=E8ge-Revil,<br>
Here is my second sup up<br>
<br>
</p>
<div><a href=3D"http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2017/01/20/antarctic-=
ice-shelf-crack-iceberg/96841060/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/20=
17/01/20/antarctic-ice-shelf-crack-iceberg/96841060/</a><br>
<br>
A crack in Antartic ice got six miles longer in twenty days which is greate=
r<br>
than the rate at which it were growing before, it leaves the iceberg with o=
nly<br>
twelve miles of connection with the Antartic, the ice sheet that will drift=
<br>
into the ocean is roughly half the size of wales. The iceberg should not<br=
>
increase sea level since it is already floating but it will release land ic=
e<br>
into the sea. Once the iceberg is isolated from Antartic, it should slowly =
move<br>
to the north and break into pieces until each pieces melt into the sea wate=
r.<br>
