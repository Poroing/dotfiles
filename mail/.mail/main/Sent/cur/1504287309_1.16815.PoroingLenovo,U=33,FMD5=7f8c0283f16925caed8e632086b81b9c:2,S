Hello Misses Blavoet
There is an issue with my Edmodo Group.
Since I'm in MPSI2 and none of the members of the group seems to be in MPSI=
2
I think=2C I've been haded to the wrong Edmodo Group=2C which is the PCE gr=
oup.
I therefore would know from you if that is the case=2C
and if so=2C if you could send me to the other group in any way.

Thank you for considering my request.

Jouve Jean
