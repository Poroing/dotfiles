<p>Hi Misses M=E8ge-Revil,<br>
Here is my second sup up<br>
<br>
</p>
<div>http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2017/01/20/antarctic-ice-shelf-c=
rack-iceberg/96841060/<br>
<br>
A crack in Antartic ice got six miles longer in twenty days which is greate=
r<br>
than the rate at which it were growing before, it leaves the iceberg with o=
nly<br>
twelve miles of connection with the Antartic, the ice sheet that will drift=
<br>
into the ocean is roughly half the size of wales. The iceberg should not<br=
>
increase sea level since it is already floating but it will release land ic=
e<br>
into the sea. Once the iceberg is isolated from Antartic, it should slowly =
move<br>
to the north and break into pieces until each pieces melt into the sea wate=
r.<br>
</div>
