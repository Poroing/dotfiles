<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here is my first summary</p>
<p><br>

<div>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38691103<br>
<br>
An avalanche created by an earthquake, destroyed and covered an hotel in<br=
>
Rigopiano Italy, two days after the event there is still people to save und=
er<br>
the snow. The only group that has been saved managed to survive the cold by=
<br>
creating a fire under a part of ceiling that did not fall to close to the<b=
r>
ground. The hotel's guests were waiting to evacuate after the earthquake wh=
en<br>
the avalanche went over the building. The first team of rescuer arrived a l=
ong<br>
time after the hotel were destroyed, the authorities didn't believe one of =
the<br>
survivor who had to call back many times for two hours. Quite an amount of<=
br>
earthquake occured lately in Italy it is thought to be caused by stress on<=
br>
lines of discontinuity in rocks.<br>
